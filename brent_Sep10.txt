
majority depoends on oracle, db2 to oracle migration needs it


1) kepler -> seqouia, call with array, regtest since already in for luw

2) dsdriver.cfg -> passwd (already delivered for fp7), not in any SES, fp2 (kepler)

3) ability to specify dsdriver.cfg file name or just the path, complicated factor - multiple apps in the same process, one use per process, new environment variable

4) MAJOR ITEM - set markup 

5) autocommit on ddl

7) (clpplus - a) sqlca after every sql, jcc has no api, 10PD

6) set stmt with host vars (jcc and server dependency) = dont know whether its in kepler




column data store - blue, in kepler, new db2 server release, thats why kepler, not 10.1 fixpack
